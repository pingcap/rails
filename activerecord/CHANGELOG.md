*   Fix migration compatibility to create SQLite references/belongs_to column as integer when migration version is 6.0.

    Reference/belongs_to in migrations with version 6.0 were creating columns as
    bigint instead of integer for the SQLite Adapter.

    *Marcelo Lauxen*

*   Add a deprecation warning when `prepared_statements` configuration is not
    set for the mysql2 adapter.

    *Thiago Araujo and Stefanni Brasil*

*   Fix `QueryMethods#in_order_of` to handle empty order list.

    ```ruby
    Post.in_order_of(:id, []).to_a
    ```

    Also more explicitly set the column as secondary order, so that any other
    value is still ordered.

    *Jean Boussier*

*   Fix quoting of column aliases generated by calculation methods.

    Since the alias is derived from the table name, we can't assume the result
    is a valid identifier.

    ```ruby
    class Test < ActiveRecord::Base
      self.table_name = '1abc'
    end
    Test.group(:id).count
    # syntax error at or near "1" (ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid)
    # LINE 1: SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_all, "1abc"."id" AS 1abc_id FROM "1...
    ```

    *Jean Boussier*

*   Add `authenticate_by` when using `has_secure_password`.

    `authenticate_by` is intended to replace code like the following, which
    returns early when a user with a matching email is not found:

    ```ruby
    User.find_by(email: "...")&.authenticate("...")
    ```

    Such code is vulnerable to timing-based enumeration attacks, wherein an
    attacker can determine if a user account with a given email exists. After
    confirming that an account exists, the attacker can try passwords associated
    with that email address from other leaked databases, in case the user
    re-used a password across multiple sites (a common practice). Additionally,
    knowing an account email address allows the attacker to attempt a targeted
    phishing ("spear phishing") attack.

    `authenticate_by` addresses the vulnerability by taking the same amount of
    time regardless of whether a user with a matching email is found:

    ```ruby
    User.authenticate_by(email: "...", password: "...")
    ```
